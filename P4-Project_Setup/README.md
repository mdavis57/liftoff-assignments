### Project Repository

(Note: I have additional front end code using ReactJS, I just haven't added it to this repo yet because I need to learn more on how to connect them! But this repo should deploy a "hello world", and if you look at the code, I have it set up to a database, I have a User class created, etc... I have a long way to go and a lot of confusion to get over, but i'm hoping I will start to pick up momentum as time goes on and I continue my effort.)
