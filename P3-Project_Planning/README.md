In my first sprint, I will create (very basic versions) of the following: 
- landing page with 2 button links, log in or sign up
- sign up page
- log in page
- Dashboard (at this point, the dashboard page will only have a "create habit" button which will link to the 'add habit' form, will display "x day streaks" for all created habits, and ability to log your daily progress by checking if it was done.)
- Add Habit form
