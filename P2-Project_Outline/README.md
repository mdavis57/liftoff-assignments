Overview

My project will be a habit tracker which will enable users to track their progress with habits they wish to start or break. There will be two given habit categories- habit making or habit breaking. Users will be able to create their own sub-categories for better organization, as well as create personal incentives upfront for when they reach their chosen milestones. The application will have capability for personal journal entries with optional prompts to keep the user engaged and in tune with their thoughts along the way, for better self reflection. Users will be able to review their progress through data and visual representation, and reviewing past journal entries.
The inspiration for this project came from my boyfriend; he is an incredibly goal oriented person striving to be his best self. This app is for him and anyone striving to better themselves. This habit tracking application will be an excellent tool to help the user gain the organization and motivation necessary to work toward their personal goals.

What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn JavaScript, as I have never used it before in past classes or personal projects. I plan on learning JavaScript through YouTube tutorials, as well as SoloLearn (a handy app I have on my phone with helpful modules to learn different technologies.) In addition to JavaScript, I will have to learn how to incorporate Chart.js, a library that will aid in implementing graphs and visual representations of data.
I'll also have to re-familiarize myself with Bootstrap; we learned a bit about this and used it near the end of the LC101 course, but I will definitely need a refresher and will need to learn to utilize it a bit more in depth.
